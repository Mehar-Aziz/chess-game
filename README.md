# Chess Game

This Python program allows you to place a treasure 'X' on a 3x3 map based on user input.

## Overview

The program initializes a 3x3 grid (`map`) filled with smiley faces ("ðŸ˜€"). It then prompts the user to enter a position where they want to place the treasure ('X'). The position is entered as a two-digit number, where the first digit represents the row and the second digit represents the column.

After placing the treasure, the updated map is displayed showing the position of the treasure.

## Usage
